Ansible Playbook for Installing Jenkins and Docker on Servers
Overview
This Ansible playbook automates the installation of Jenkins and Docker on remote servers. It is designed to simplify the setup process and ensure consistent configurations across your servers.

Prerequisites
Before running the Ansible playbook, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1 Ansible Installed: Ensure that Ansible is installed on your local machine from which you intend to run the playbook. You can install Ansible, for example, on Ubuntu using the following command:
"sudo apt-get install ansible"

2 Configure the Inventory File: To manage remote servers, add their IP addresses to the "hosts" file. Make sure you grant the necessary permissions to the "hosts" file using:
"sudo chmod 777 hosts"

3 Test SSH Connectivity: Verify that the .pem key is correctly placed and functional by attempting to SSH into a remote server from your head server using the following command
sudo ssh -i /path/to/your/.pem_key username@ip_address_of_server
make sure to give access to your .pem file using "SUDO CHMOD 600 /.SSH/ANSIBLE-KEY" 

4 Check Server Connectivity: Confirm that all remote servers are successfully connected by pinging them with Ansible:
"ansible -i /path/to/your/inventory -m ping all"

5 Run Playbooks: After confirming successful server connections, create your playbooks and execute them using the following command:
"ansible-playbook -i /path/to/your/inventory your_playbook.yml"

6 Ensure you replace /path/to/your/ and your_playbook.yml with the appropriate paths and playbook filenames. This playbook will automate the installation of Jenkins and Docker on your servers, making the process efficient and consistent.
